SAS programs for financial analysis

The SAS programs I used during my Honours and PhD in Finance at the University of Sydney Business School.

I do not hold responsibility for the correctness and accuracy of the programs, though I've ensured my greatest efforts in making them effective and efficient.

The programs are under continuous development so changes to the coding and even algorithm should be expected.
